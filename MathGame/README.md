# MathGame
My C# MathGame

Math game where you perform mathematics and try to get as high as possible. 
You can preselect starting levels - or start from 1 - and the game will increment the difficulty as you progress.

The game will have the following features
1. Scoreboard (memory only - no db)
2. Mulitple Levels
3. Ability to start a new game - while the scoreboard keeps track of all the other games played.

Update 15 March 2023 
Fun challenge to make this - First proper project i have undertaken. 
Game has a ton more complexity than i initially planned, Some of it is crazy messy, but overall i am very happy with it.
Will return to it in the future and add database logic! 

Game has most of what i initially planned, I could keep adding/smoothing out the features, but i want to build additional projects. 

TODOs :
	More levels 
	Ability to start from a select level 
	Player "experience" with unlocks (maybe ability to skip some levels?)
	Addtional scoreboard features (Highscores, search)
	Additional Player features (Search, customize properties, etc.)
